     I chose the quote ""Wherever you go, go with all your heart." because it has been one of my favourites for a long time. I made the word "heart" a hover on the largest screen size and not the smaller phone sizes because when you are on a phone you don't have a mouse to move around the page and discover that colour change, therefore it would be useless. I chose the a simple and easy to read serif font for the majority of the quote so that it was not distracting from the word that I wanted to put emphasis on. The word that I wanted to create emphasis on is the word hear and I did this by making the word a little bit larger than the other text, changing it to a readable sans-serif font and changing the colour. I made the text the size that it is so that it would take up most of the screen and not waste the space. I chose to make the name Confucius smaller than the rest of the text because he is the source of the quote. I used these colours because they complemented each other well because orange and blue are complementary colours and red and blue are primary colours. I used white text over black text because I feel like black text would have been too harsh with the other colours. One challenge overcame was putting the text on separate lines by creates separate div and span tags. Another challenge was deciding what sizes of text to use so that the space was used effectively and not wasted.
